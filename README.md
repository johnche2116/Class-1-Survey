# Class 1 Survey Data Analysis

## Project Description
This repository includes the Class 1 survey dataset and R code used
to analyze it. The project is part of an exercise to practice working with
real-world data in R using reproducible coding practices.

## Files Included
- `Class1_Survey_Fall2025.csv`: Original Class 1 survey dataset
- `Class1_Survey_Analysis.R`: R script used to summarize and clean the data
- `README.md`: This file

## What the Code Does
- Reads in the survey dataset directly from GitHub or local CSV
- Performs basic data cleaning (e.g., renaming columns, filtering out invalid values)
- Calculates summary statistics (e.g., number of observations, variable types)
- Analyzes date of birth fields and assigns birth seasons
- Answers a custom question using one or more variables (favorite season in this case)

## How to Run the Code
1. Download or clone this repository to your computer
2. Open `Class1_Survey_Analysis.R` in RStudio
3. Make sure your working directory is set to the folder where the files are saved
4. Run the script step by step to see all analysis results in the Console
